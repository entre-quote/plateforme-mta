We provide engineering support to meet our customers specific needs including tests results analysis (see section Services and Procedures). Accordingly, we take an overall approach to supporting our customers and our ESS testing services cover a broad range of industry needs. 

* Testing from 1V-simple cell to a 600V-full battery pack.
* Testing from basic (capacitance or resistance metrology) to complex battery systems (packs with BMS, SIL / HIL, communication interfaces ...).
* **Advanced thermal assessment**, either on cells or modules, through our expertise and our equipment (many instrumentations, thermal camera, water or air thermal conditioning...).
* **Long term** testing for several months without interruption, 24 hours a day.
* **Battery software (BMS) development** testing (SOC indicators, SOH, transitions, modes of communication ...)
* **Characterization** or mapping tests of detailed ESS over wide parameter ranges (-60°C to +70°C, from +/-1mA to +/-1000A, from 1mV to 600V)
* Product **qualification** testing, according to many standards (ISO, ANSI, IEC, DO ...), along with full result report.

In any case, MTA conducts a safety study of test setup and then runs different test scenarios before offering the one that serves the client’s need.

**We provide a systemic approach when it comes to perform a test by enhancing safety shielding in order to ensure operators and equipment safety:**

* **Preventive** safety: an anhydrous nitrogen generator, which makes it possible to work under an anhydrous atmosphere (for unvarnished electronic boards for example) and depleted in oxygen.
* **Active** safety: systematic monitoring of the current, voltage and  temperatures during the SSE testing
* **Curative** safety: automatic gas extinguishing devices of the SSE in the event of fire detection.

Additionally, MTA can offer small equipment required for personnel and equipment protection against failure risks (insulating gloves (1000V), insulated tools, arc flash visor ...) to ensure proper handling of the ESS.

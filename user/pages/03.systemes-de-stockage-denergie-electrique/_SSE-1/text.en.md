**Energy Storage System** is as the name suggests a device used for storing electric energy when needed and releasing it when required. The energy is then usually stored in an electrochemical form. These systems have a distinctive feature of including an accessible connection (+ and - terminals) which is capable of generating and / or storing a continuous electrical power directly (without transformation).

* Batteries of all kind of technologies (alkaline, Li//SOCl2,  Li//SO2, Li//MnO2…) [non rechargeable]
* Lead-acid accumulators
* NiCd accumulators
* NiMH accumulators
* Lithium-ion accumulators
* Supercapacitors

A “Battery pack” consists of a multiple assembly of several accumulators (or batteries) linked in series and / or in parallel, with or without a battery management system (BMS).

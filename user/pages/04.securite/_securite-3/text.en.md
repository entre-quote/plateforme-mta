In order to prevent the risks associated with ESS during testing, MTA offers various safety tools and are categorized in three different and complementary types as shown below:

**Preventive safety:**  
The principle is here to prevent the potential hazard and act upstream. This phase consists of setting up protections against the failure risks and/or unwanted event by controlling the atmosphere of the test. In response, we apply the continuous use of a gas generator by scanning the volume of the test chamber. The ambient atmosphere is sufficiently diluted with an **inert** atmosphere (in order to reduce the oxygen ratio below the combustible mix limit) and **anhydrous** atmosphere (without water to avoid the risk of condensation) and thus preserving the test support.


**Active safety:**  
As already mentioned, we first run a customized safety study, which generally leads to the implementation of specific surveillance and safety tools during the testing process. In addition to this phase, we carry out a **permanent monitoring** of voltages, currents and temperatures during each test. If the safety limits are exceeded, we perform an automatic (and quick, <1s) shutdown of all test equipment (bench, chamber, thermal conditioning, etc.). Without this automatic shutdown, irreversible damage can occur.

**Curative safety:**  
In case, neither preventive nor active actions have worked, a third level of safety is implemented: curative security systems for automatic fire suppression. These systems are not only specifically designed for our facilities but also has adapted protection features to prevent potential hazards. Our systems have the benefit of extinguishing SSE fires by injecting inert gas into the test chamber. These automatic fire suppression systems (24/7) are useful to control and prevent the fire from spreading until the arrival of fire response team.

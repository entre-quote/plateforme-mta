The **safety** of people and equipment is MTAâ€™s number one priority and we pay special attention to the systems under tests. That is why we constantly focus on guaranteeing the highest quality standards, improve our test procedures and methods as well as ensure that our key personnel are properly trained. Before starting any testing, we systematically carry out **a safety study**, which is valuable information to collaborate effectively with our customers. The purpose of these studies is to advise our clients, to identify the specific risks of their technologies and designs, and to identify **simple and concrete solutions** to be implemented while conducting tests. We then take care of putting in place these specific solutions adapted to the device under test.
